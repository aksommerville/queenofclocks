## TODO

- [x] I think the current graphics are too fussy. Don't use an outline. Try a black sky and light walls (unoutlined sprites would read great against black).
- [x] Hero motion.
- [x] Physics. Generalize. We'll need a strong concept of seating, there's going to be lots of moving platforms.
- [ ] One-way platforms? I didn't account for these in physics. Do we want?
- [ ] Wall hugging?
- [ ] Wall jump?
- [x] Moving platforms.
- - [x] How to communicate with the hero? It's important that riding platforms operate smoothly.
- [ ] Pushable blocks. (are we doing that?)
- [ ] Timed flamethrowers.
- [ ] Other moving hazards. Chainsaw on wheels, etc.
- [ ] Conveyor belts.
- [ ] Wand.
- [ ] Goal and advancement.
- [x] Music. I think just one song.
- [ ] Sound effects.
