## TODO

- [x] Wall hugging? ...nah
- [x] Flammable blocks that when fryguy encounters one, he farts fire on it. ...no
- [x] Other moving hazards. Chainsaw on wheels, etc. ...we're good
- [x] Real maps. 10..15 should be good.
- [x] Put maps in order.
- [x] Don't wand thru walls. Or do. Or a fixed distance limit. Does it matter? ...it's better with wand-thru-wall, hey it's magic
- [x] Sound effects.
- [x] Scorekeeping.
- [ ] AUX1 for a quickie menu. Restart Level, End Game, Quit. Important because I can't guarantee there won't be any soft-lock situations.

- [ ] Game over music.
